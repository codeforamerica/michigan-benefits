## Getting Set Up

### macOS

Install [Homebrew].

Install [Heroku CLI].

`brew install heroku/brew/heroku`

Install and start PostgreSQL.

`brew install postgresql`

`brew services start postgresql`

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/
[Heroku CLI]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

### Ruby on Rails

This application is built using [Ruby on Rails].

Your system will require [Ruby] to develop on the application.

The required Ruby version is listed in the [.ruby-version](.ruby-version) file.

If you do not have this binary, [use this guide to get set up on MacOS].

[Ruby on Rails]: http://rubyonrails.org
[Ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
[use this guide to get set up on MacOS]: http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/macintosh

### Configuring the Application

* After cloning this repo, run: `bin/setup`.

## Day-to-day Development

### Local Server

* Run the server(s): `foreman start`
* Visit [your local server](http://localhost:3000)
* To preview any emails that were sent while testing locally, visit the [running mailcatcher instance](http://localhost:1080/)
* Run tests and Rubocop: `rake`

### Conventions
* **Secrets** - api keys and secrets should be placed in `config/secrets.yml` and
  referenced via Rails' secrets api. Eg: `Rails.application.secrets.an_api_key`.


### Step Navigation

This application is a long questionnaire.
You will probably want to work on parts of it
without completing the whole application.

After booting the server and filling out the first step,
go to `http://localhost:3000/steps`
to jump around the SNAP and Medicaid flows, 
or `http://localhost:3000/forms` for the Integrated application.


### Testing

#### Spec Helpers

* Use `with_modified_env` to modify an env variable for one test:

```ruby
with_modified_env INVITATION_CODE: "inv-code", INVITATIONS_ENABLED: "true" do
  post :create, user: { name: "Alice", invitation_code: "wrong-code" }
  expect(flash[:alert]).to equal "Invalid invitation code"
end
```

* Use `match_html` to test that two HTML strings match, excluding whitespace, order of attributes, etc.:

```ruby
expect(rendered).to match_html <<-HTML
  <table class="foo bar">
  <tr>
  <td>Hi!</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
HTML
```

### Document / Photo Uploading Details

* The file uploading service is called [Shubox]. The [dashboard] can be
accessed with account info found in 1password. Contact [@jayroh] for any
questions or issues related to Shubox.
* The file limit is currently set to 8MB. That can be bumped up if we notice
that people are often taking photos or attaching documents larger than that.
* The file formats currently allowed as "Documents" consist of:
  * .gif
  * .jpg
  * .pdf
  * .png

### Rebuilding the Docker image for CI

To run tests and other checks on Circle CI, we use a custom Docker image hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/chartsockcfa/michigan-benefits-ci/).

To update this image (for example, when we update our version of ruby in the app):

* cd into `.ci`
* Make any required updates to the Dockerfile (updating base image, adding dependencies, etc.)
* With [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) running, type `docker build` in Terminal to build the image
* Push the image with a unique tag to Docker Hub (with tag) via instructions [here](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/04-Dockerhub.html)
* Update the image tag in our Circle CI config at `.circleci/config.yml`


### Admin dashboard

Our admin dashboard is built with [administrate].

In order to access the admin dashboard in any environment, you'll need an
`AdminUser` account.

To add new users on staging and production, those with Heroku access can create
accounts via Heroku console. Example:

```
heroku run rails c -r staging
AdminUser.create!(email: "jessie@example.com", password: SecureRandom.base64)
```

If you are creating an account for someone else, you can instruct them to visit
`/admin_users/password/new` (eg:
https://staging.michiganbenefits.org/admin_users/password/new) and enter their
email address. Submitting the form on that page triggers a password reset email.

### Deploying

See [DEPLOYING.md](DEPLOYING.md)

## Workflow

NOTE: See [DESIGN-README.md](DESIGN-README.md) for design-specific
resources and workflow.

### Planning

* A change is initiated and discussed via a
  [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2123705) story.
* All new Tracker stories are added to the top of the Icebox
* Before the weekly planning meeting, prioritized Tracker stories are written and moved over to the Backlog in order of priority.
 Cards in this list should have enough detail to be actionable. Top priority items are at the top of the list.
* During the weekly planning meeting, stories are reviewed, clarified by product and design
 if necessary, and estimated by the engineering team.
* Stories are estimated on a Fibonacci scale from 0 to 8 according to their perceived complexity.
* During the team's weekly retro meetings, feedback about the workflow is noted
  and related changes are incorporated into this document.


### Bugs

A problem is first noticed, e.g. Alert comes in, team member pings us "I haven't seen text messages coming in over the weekend. Something might be wrong."
Person who noticed the problem, writes a bug and puts it at the top of the Icebox.

A product manager should then review the bug and place it in proper priority in the Backlog, adding any steps
necessary to reproduce the bug.

### Work In Progress

* When someone starts working on a task, they click "Start" on the Tracker story. This will assign the
  task to them, and make it clear that the task is in progress.
* All code is written on a branch *other* than `master`. The team is not picky
  about branch naming.

### Debugging

* Call `binding.pry` anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console.
* Access an IRB console on exception pages or by using `<%= console %>` anywhere in the code.
* To get a good look at and debug any emails that were sent from your running
development environment visit your local [mailhog server](http://localhost:8025/).


### Code Review

* A Pull Request (PR) is created on GitHub. All PRs should have [a good commit
  message](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message) and a
  link to the Tracker story in the PR summary. When a PR completes a Tracker story, mark that story as 'Finished'
  in Pivotal Tracker. [Here's a handy trick to do it automatically](#Finished)
* The PR Author can request reviews via GitHub's [request a pull request
  review](https://help.github.com/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review/)
feature. In general, the team prioritizes code reviews over other work.
* Before a PR can be merged into `master` it must:
  * Have been QA'd locally by the PR author.
  * Pass checks for Circle CI (these can be seen in the PR itself via GitHub webhooks).
  * Have the explicit approval of one or more teammates via GitHub's approval
    feature.

### Merging

* By default, it is expected that the PR author will merge when ready. In some
  cases, a reviewer may merge if merging is time-sensitive or the author is
  unavailable to merge for some reason.
* Whoever merges a branch into `master` deletes the branch after merging.
* Merged code is automatically deployed to the [staging
  environment](https://michigan-benefits-staging.herokuapp.com/) after a green
build on Circle CI.
* Once code completing a Tracker story is deployed to staging, mark the story as 'Delivered'. This
  indicates that it is ready for acceptance.
* When two people are pairing on something, code can be merged to `master`
  without an explicit PR / code review process. A pull request should still be opened, to trigger 
  Circle CI to run specs before merging to master.

### Acceptance Testing

* Before deploying to production, we ask a teammate who _did not_ work on the feature to test our change on staging.
* Ideally, the story author has put explicit acceptance steps into the card.
* Review on [staging site](https://staging.michiganbenefits.org). If all looks well, click "Accept".
* If you have a question, ask it in the card and leave in the Accept/Reject state.
* If not, comment with specifics about what was incorrect and click "Reject". A developer will then pick up
the story, fix the issues, and redeliver.
* Once stories have been accepted, they are ready for deployment.

#### Testing Document Uploads on Staging

NOTE: Document upload via [Shubox] on staging requires using this URL:

[http://staging.michiganbenefits.org](http://staging.michiganbenefits.org)

and will not work on this URL:

[https://michigan-benefits-staging.herokuapp.com](https://michigan-benefits-staging.herokuapp.com)

### Tracker flow and integrations

Our Pivotal Tracker project is set up with the [Github integration](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/githubs_service_hook_for_tracker/#formatting-your-commits), allowing developers to take
automate some setting of status on stories. The Github integration is configured to listen for Tracker stories
in commits pushed to any branch.

#### Started/In Progress

Regularly tag your commits with the Tracker story ID in Tracker ([#STORYID]). When pushed to a branch,
these will post as comments on the Tracker story and indicate that the story is in progress. Pushing a tagged commit
will automatically mark the story as "Started".

#### Finished

When a feature is complete and you're ready to open a PR, include the tag [Finishes #STORYID] in the commit message. When pushed, this will then mark
the Tracker story as finished.

#### Delivered

When the PR is merged into master and the feature is deployed to staging, manually mark the story as
"Delivered" in Tracker.

#### Accepted/Rejected

See [Acceptance Testing](#acceptance-testing)

## Driving Applications on MIBridges.org

In the past, after clients complete our application form,
      we have used web driver software to fill in values
      on the [MIbridges.org](http://mibridges.org) application.
      
We have discontinued webdriving for the time being.

### Requirements

1. A sufficiently complete `SnapApplication`
2. Chrome and Chromedriver are installed (the latest versions). `./bin/setup`
should get this set up for you automatically.

### How to Drive Applications

To run the driver code, use `bin/drive <id>` (where
`<id>` is the id of a snap application record):

There are three extra environment variables you can set to modify the behavior
of the script.

| Variable      | Purpose |
| ------------- | -----------|
| `WEB_DRIVER=chrome` | If you would like it to run in a FULL chrome browser instead of the headless version |
| `DRIVER_SPEED=slow` or `medium` | If you'd like it to run a little slower, perhaps for demo purposes or to look more "human" |
| `DEBUG_DRIVE=true` | If you would like to display a log of some of the things happening as it "drives" |

Example:

```sh
DRIVER_SPEED=slow \
  WEB_DRIVER=chrome \
  DEBUG_DRIVE=true \
  bin/drive 1234
