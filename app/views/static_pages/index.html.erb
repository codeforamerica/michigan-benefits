        The following is an application for both food assistance (SNAP) and healthcare (Medicaid) that was designed,
        built, and piloted for nine months with Applicants in Flint, Michigan. This work was a joint initiative between
        Code for America and Civilla. It was funded by a Process and Technology Improvement Grant from the Food and
        Nutrition Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed alongside people applying for services in Flint, this form aimed to be easier to understand, faster to
        use, as well as deliver a more accurate application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early results from the pilot show this approach reduced the time it takes to complete an application to ten
        minutes, improved approval rates by 35%, and earned a user satisfaction rate of 74%.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is for example purposes only. If you need to submit an application, apply on MI Bridges. Otherwise,
        please continue to the demo.
