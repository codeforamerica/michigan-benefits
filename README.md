## Developing

### Getting Started

* After cloning this repo, run: `bin/setup`
* Read through the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file to learn how this
  team operates.

### Onboarding Checklist

Ask the team for access to the following services to begin contributing:

* GitHub
* Slack

### Day-to-day

* Run the server(s): `foreman start`
* Visit [your local server](http://localhost:3000)
* To preview any emails that were sent while testing locally, visit
  the [running mailcatcher instance](http://localhost:1080/)
* Run tests and Rubocop: `rake`

### Deploying

* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/codeforamerica/michigan-benefits) is currently set up to
  deploy green builds to **staging**.
* Use heroku pipelines to promote from staging to **production**. If you want to promote
  from the Heroku web page or CLI, be sure to run migrations afterwards.

### Debugging

* Call `binding.pry` anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console.
* Access an IRB console on exception pages or by using `<%= console %>` anywhere in the code.
* To get a good look at and debug any emails that were sent from your running
  development environment visit your local [mailcatcher server](http://localhost:1080/).

### Spec Helpers

* Use `with_modified_env` to modify an env variable for one test:

```ruby
with_modified_env INVITATION_CODE: "inv-code", INVITATIONS_ENABLED: "true" do
  post :create, user: { name: "Alice", invitation_code: "wrong-code" }
  expect(flash[:alert]).to equal "Invalid invitation code"
end
```

* Use `match_html` to test that two HTML strings match, excluding whitespace, order of attributes, etc.:

```ruby
expect(rendered).to match_html <<-HTML
  <table class="foo bar">
    <tr>
      <td>Hi!</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
HTML
```
